# Audit: content-data (2026-11-09)

Area 3 of the whole-project audit: `data/curriculum`, `data/kits`, `data/kits-relevel`, `data/lesson-scripts-staged`, `data/placement`, `data/arena`, `data/geo`, `scripts/kits`, `server/content`. Base: `int/r6` at integration 21a. Nothing paid was called.

## Summary

- **No wrong answer key was found.** 1,802 items were solved blind (keys withheld until the answers were written) and every stored key agreed in substance. That includes all 456 placement items. A wrong key would have been P0; there is none in the sample.
- **The worst defect is in how content is used, not in the keys.** Eight topics can never be finished because one of their skills has nothing to ask (CD-01). English reading questions lose their passage in a Hinglish lesson (CD-02, CD-03), and a third of class 9 English never loads (CD-04).
- **The curriculum graph is clean.** 830 topics, 830 kits, no duplicate ids, no missing or orphan kits, no dangling, forward or circular prerequisites.
- Counts: 23 findings. P0 0, P1 8, P2 9, P3 6. Broken 7, inconsistent 8, not good enough 5, no longer needed 3.
- **Skeptic pass:** one agent tried to refute all 23. None was refuted. Six were corrected in mechanism, count or wording (CD-01, CD-02, CD-13, CD-15, CD-17, CD-22), and this report carries the corrected versions.

## What was solved blind

Nine solver agents each got questions without keys, wrote their answers, and only then opened the keys. I checked every disagreement they raised against the data myself.

| Batch | Content | Solved | Wrong keys |
|---|---|---|---|
| Maths, classes 1-3 | 120 kit items, 30 diagnostics, 24 worked examples | 174 | 0 |
| Maths, classes 4-5 | 80 kit items, 20 diagnostics, 16 worked examples, 72 placement | 188 | 0 |
| Maths, classes 6-7 | 80 kit items, 20 diagnostics, 16 worked examples, 72 placement | 188 | 0 |
| Maths, classes 8-9 and placement 3, 8 | 80 kit items, 20 diagnostics, 16 worked examples, 84 placement | 200 | 0 |
| Science, classes 6-9 | 120 kit items, 24 diagnostics | 144 | 0 |
| EVS, classes 3-5 | 90 kit items, 18 diagnostics, 120 placement | 228 | 0 |
| Social science 6-9, science placement 6-8 | 80 kit items, 24 diagnostics, 108 placement | 212 | 0 |
| English, classes 1-9 | 180 kit items, 54 diagnostics | 234 | 0 |
| Hindi, classes 1-9 | 180 kit items, 54 diagnostics | 234 | 0 |
| **Total** | 1,010 kit items, 264 diagnostics, 72 worked examples, 456 placement | **1,802** | **0** |

The kit sample is seeded and random within each class and subject file: 40 items per maths file, 30 per science or EVS file, 20 per English, Hindi or social science file (8% of the 12,597 kit items). Placement was solved in full.

Limits of this check:
- Some English and Hindi items for classes 1-6 ask about a story, poem or picture the prompt does not carry (the English solver counted about 25). The solvers guessed 14 of them wrong (6 English, 8 Hindi) and could not re-derive the key. Those keys are unverified, not confirmed (see CD-03).
- The solvers are the same model family as this session. The kits' own blind solve used other families (DeepSeek, Grok), so the two checks are independent of each other.

## Findings

Owner is the stream that owns the path. "Mine" in the status column means I fix it in phase 2 under the rule for this area. "Waits" means it needs main's reply first.

## Evidence

### CD-01: eight topics can never be finished

- `topicStatus` calls a topic learned only when every one of its skills is learned (`server/content/next-topic.js:23-25`), and `nextTopicFor` counted `kit.skills.length` skills (line 134).
- Eight skills have no item after the kit loads:
  - no item in the kit at all (reading-aloud and recitation skills): `c5-hindi-ch05-t01-s1`, `c5-hindi-ch06-t01-s1`, `c5-hindi-ch08-t01-s1`, `c6-hindi-ch03-t01-s1`;
  - every item dropped by the prompt budget (CD-04): `c8-english-ch01-t01-s1`, `c9-english-ch01-t01-s1`, `c9-english-ch07-t01-s1`, `c9-english-ch11-t01-s1`.
- Such a skill can be taught (the explain step, the faded worked step and teach-back all write its row), but "learned" needs an unaided correct answer to an item of that skill (`server/learner/kt/ledger.js:340-344`). There is no such item. The skeptic simulated four sessions of teaching on it: the skill stays "practising" and the topic "in_progress". My first draft had the mechanism wrong (it said no row is written); the outcome is the same.
- Reproduced with the real kits: with every other skill of `c5-hindi-ch05-t01` mastered, `topicStatus` returns `in_progress` and `pickTopic` over the class 5 Hindi order returns the same topic, not `c5-hindi-ch06-t01`.
- What the child sees: the topic is offered again as the next lesson. The calendar or the parent's chapter can rotate it to the back of the order, but it is never done, and the parent corner shows it as never finished.
- **Fixed** in `nextTopicFor`: a topic is decided only on its askable skills (`decidingStates`). `server/routes/parent.js:1196` makes the same count for the parent page and is in the learner area: it should call the same helper.

### CD-02: reading questions without their passage

- `promptFor(item, lang)` returns `prompt_hi` unless the lesson language is English (`server/director/items.js:24`).
- `c8-english-ch10-t01-i01`: `prompt_en` begins "Read: 'When Tara was eight, she planted a cherry stone beside her grandmother's kitchen door in Shimla…'". `promptFor(item, "hinglish")` is the whole of: "Kahani suno. Tara ne cherry ki guthli kahan boyi?"
- Count: about 190 items where `prompt_en` quotes a text, none of it is in `prompt_hi`, and `prompt_hi` is under 45% of its length (185 by my count, 195 by the skeptic's). 107 of them load: c7-english 47, c8-english 31, c5-english 16, c9-english 12, c3-english 1. The rest are dropped at load for every language (CD-04). The English solver reported the same pattern independently.
- One path does carry `prompt_en` in a non-English lesson: the board planner drafts a speculative board from it (`server/stagecraft/board-sync.js:55`). Neither the skeptic nor I traced whether a passage is ever drawn. The client reads no prompt field.
- Related, not counted: items that lean on the item before them ("the same reaction", `c9-science-ch09-t01-i02`) cannot be answered when served alone.

### CD-03: the stored story is never read

- 48 kit topics carry a `passage`: every topic of c1, c2, c3 and c4 English, and 2 of c3 Hindi. Example, `c3-english-ch09-t01`: "Pihu had a wish. 'I wish I had a tiffin full of aloo parathas…'".
- No file under `server/`, `src/`, `shared/` or `scripts/` reads `.passage`, and `normalizeKit` does not copy it (`server/content/kits.js:119-131`).
- `c3-english-ch09-t01-i01` asks "What was Pihu's first wish?". The story is the product's own, so no textbook has it either.
- `context/rejected.md`, `kit-invented-companion-texts`, already says: "Never keep an invented text unless it is stored and shown in the lesson." It is stored; it is not shown.

### CD-04: class 8-9 English items dropped at load

- `normalizeKit` drops an item that does not fit the pinned prompt section (`checkFits`, `server/content/kits.js:110`). It drops 111 items across all kits; 102 are in c8-english and c9-english, each carrying its own 400-600 character passage.
- Per topic, c9-english keeps 7 to 11 of 13 to 16 items. Four skills lose every item (CD-01).
- The drop is counted in `kit.lint.itemsDropped` and shown nowhere.

### CD-05, CD-06, CD-07: right answers marked wrong

- `c1-maths-ch03-t03-i11`: English "Which do you reach later, 3 or 7?"; Hindi "Pehle 3 aayega ya 7?" (which comes first). Accepted: 7, seven, saat. A child who answers the Hindi question correctly says 3.
- `c6-english-ch01-t01-rl-h3`: "…she joined ___ art club." Accepted: "saw; the", "saw, the", "saw the". "saw; an" is correct English and is refused.
- `pl-c4-maths-m11`: answer "3:25 p.m.", no accepted forms. `gradePlacement` gives `null` for "3:25 pm" and "3:25" (no credit) and `false` for "3.25".

### CD-08, CD-15: arena challenges that do not fit their question

- `build-arena.mjs:30` `head()` cuts the kit answer at ". ". For an answer written as a numbered list ("1. Stop and stay in one place. 2. …") the head is "1", which parses as a number, so the challenge becomes: "Say the lost-child plan in three steps." with tiles 3, 6, 2, 1 and key 1. The second case, `c9-maths-ch11-t01-i09`, is in a topic the arena serves (`eligible: true`).
- 548 of 1,982 numeric challenges take their key from an accepted form because the head of the answer is not a number (line 141, `?? nums[0]`). Most of those are fine ("तीन" → 3, "About 37 °C" → 37). The bad subset is the 103 whose kit answer starts with yes or no, plus a few whose answer is a name or a choice ("Mohan", "Way B"). Examples: "Why is 4.8 ÷ 0.6 the same as 48 ÷ 6?" with tiles 4, 8, 13, 9; "Which statement is a complete measurement? (a)… (b)… (c)… Explain." with tiles 13 m, 12 m, 14 m, 21 m.
- The arena data is otherwise in step with the kits: `build-arena.mjs --check` passes, every key is among its options exactly once, and no decoy equals the key by value.

### CD-09, CD-16, CD-17: the friend slot

- Kits use `{friendF}` 747 times so that a story character is never the child and never the teacher (`server/director/friend.js:1`).
- Still naming Asha or Riya, in text the teacher says: items `c1-maths-ch05-t02-i14`, `c8-english-ch06-t01-i15`, `c8-maths-ch01-t03-i14`, `c8-maths-ch10-t01-i16`; diagnostics `c1-maths-ch06-t02-m-wrong-fact`, `c1-maths-ch08-t01-m-bundle-as-one`, `c2-maths-ch11-t01-m-counted-twice`, `c3-maths-ch07-t01-m-turn-changes-total`, `c3-maths-ch10-t01-m-unit-any-word`, `c4-maths-ch05-t02-m-metre-is-1000`, `c4-maths-ch10-t01-m-aim-for-nine`, `c6-maths-ch09-t01-m-slide-copy`, `c8-maths-ch14-t01-m-height-wrong-base`, `c9-maths-ch03-t03-m-tried-some`. These were added after the slot script last ran. Another 49 strings in `skillExamples` name them too.
- `scripts/kits/friend-slot.py:4` still says it is "HELD until the Games banks fill {friendF} too". The banks do fill it (`server/play/levels.js:97`), and the kits already carry the script's output.
- `server/forge/g2/levels.js` reads raw kit text and never fills the slot: 13 of its 880 specs carry a literal `{friendF}` (first: `c1-maths-ch05-t02`).
- The script only matches Latin letters. The name रिया stays as a whole word 55 times in the Hindi kits, and in 18 items and diagnostics the English prompt has the slot while the Hindi prompt says रिया (`c3-hindi-ch07-t01-i02`, `c6-hindi-ch06-t01-rl-h3`).
- Placement names Riya 58 times and Asha 10 times and has no slot. Placement is not spoken by the teacher, so this is noted, not counted.

### CD-10: accepted forms that are wrong

- `c3-hindi-ch04-t01-i13` ("Say 'चिड़िया'. Is the first sound short or long?") accepts "चिड़िया", the word the child was told to say.
- `c3-hindi-ch09-t01-i08` ("Find the naming words") accepts "तीन शब्द" (three words), which names none.
- `c8-hindi-ch05-t01-i08` (finish Kabir's doha, "…आज करै सो ___") accepts "abhi" and "अभी". The word is "अब".

### CD-11: lines no teacher would say

| Where | Now | Should be |
|---|---|---|
| `c4-evs-ch09-t02-i04` prompt_hi | "ek patli 3 (tin) ki chhat aur deewaron wali" | "ek patli tin ki chaadar ki chhat aur deewaron wali" (the numeral rewrite hit the metal) |
| `c4-english-ch09-t01-rl-h1` both prompts | "During a kho-kho match, Kabir held the rope firmly" | a tug-of-war match (kho-kho has no rope) |
| `c7-science-ch04-t01-i03` prompt_hi | "kaun ki aawaaz goonjegi" | "kiski aawaaz goonjegi" |
| `c7-maths-ch01-t01-rl-h3` prompt_hi | "Event A ya Event B—and kaunsa" | "…aur kaunsa" |
| diagnostic `c9-science-ch01-t03-m2` prompt_hi | "theory bada hokar law ban jaati hai" | "badi hokar" |
| diagnostic `c8-science-ch01-t01-m3` prompt_hi | "Usse aur kya chahiye?" | "Use aur kya chahiye?" |
| `pl-c7-science-e12` prompt_hi | "microbes ko marne ke liye" (to die) | "maarne ke liye" (to kill) |
| `pl-c4-maths-e03` prompt_hi | "chauṛa" | "chauda" |
| `pl-c4-maths-m05` prompt_hi | "ek baar baad lagane ke liye" ("baad" reads as "after") | "ek baar baadh (fence) lagane ke liye" |

Across 1,802 items the solvers flagged about ten lines of Hinglish. The register is otherwise natural.

### CD-13, CD-14: placement bank

- Same numbers and same answer at two anchors in one class, both usable: c5-maths m10 and l02 (GE 4.5 and 4.8; the wording differs by two words), c5-maths m12 and l07, c5-maths m11 and l05, c3-maths m01 and e05, c8-maths e10 and m01, c4-evs e09 and m02. One placement can show a child the same sum twice, and one sum carries two difficulty values.
- Close variants, same scenario asked differently or with other numbers: c4-maths m05 and l01, c7-maths e11 and m03, c6-science m10 and l02, c7-science m06 and l01.
- `pl-c8-maths-l10` (7, 9, 5 → 30) is anchored at GE 7.8. Its own blind solve disagreed (`verified.agrees: false`) and it is usable only through `adjudicated`. Two solvers here flagged it as class 3-4 arithmetic.
- Also seen, not counted: the correct option is stored first in 247 of 257 placement MCQs. `server/placement/session.js:15` shuffles per item, so the child does not see that order.

### CD-18: homework matching

- `matchHomework("fractions", { class_level: 5 })` finds `c5-maths-ch02-t01`. `matchHomework("fractions ka homework hai", …)` finds only the subject. "photosynthesis ke questions likhne hain" for class 7 finds nothing.
- Cause: `findTopicLiteral` requires every word of four or more letters to start a title word (`server/content/curriculum.js`), which is right for a short named subject and wrong for a sentence. `context/rejected.md` `rj-r4t-findtopic-as-intake` records exactly this, so `findTopic` should stay as it is and the caller should change. `server/homework` is outside this area.

### CD-19 to CD-22: left over

- Mini-kits: 830 of 830 topics normalize from a file, so `getKit` returns at line 47 of `server/content/index.js` every time. `kits.js:2` still says kits "are generated by another workflow WHILE this code runs".
- `node scripts/kits/w5-decide.mjs` stops at its first rewrite ("occurs 0 times"): all were applied. `node scripts/kits/w2-merge.mjs` reports 0 items left to give a measured level (4,695 of 4,695 already have one). Neither they nor `w5-decisions.json` are named by a test, a package script or CI. `scripts/kits/lib/runner.mjs:12` points at `scripts/kits/merge.mjs`, which does not exist.
- `data/kits-relevel` (3 MB) is already folded into the kits, but `tests/rs6-merged-kits.test.mjs` reads it and `context/` cites it. It stays.
- `data/kits/SCHEMA.md:8` lists three subjects; there are six. `skillExamples` (706 examples in 352 topics, about 600 KB) is dropped by `normalizeKit` and read by no product code. It exists for the people and agents who write lesson scripts.
- `node data/curriculum/validate.mjs` passes (38 files, 518 chapters, 830 topics, 629 prerequisite links) but no committed test, package script or CI step ran it. `tests/r7-audit-content-data.test.mjs` now does.

### CD-23: staged lesson scripts (report only)

- All 30 pass `LESSON_SCRIPTS_DIR=data/lesson-scripts-staged node scripts/lesson-scripts/check.mjs --all`: structure 0, boards 0, runtime 0.
- They are format 2.2. The four pilots are 2.3 and all carry `answerBoard` on asks, on the worked example's `yourStep`, on checks and on remediation `then` cards. No staged script has any of them.
- Against director14-16:
  - **Dropped points (director16 cause 3):** not present. None of the 248 staged points contains a "?" sentence for `say.js` to drop.
  - **Held board (D11):** all 147 staged remediations carry their own board, different from their then-card's board. So do all 27 in the live pilots. Under the held board each one shares its card's board, so every remediation, staged and live, needs Learning's rework.
  - **A card that answers itself, a "?" over stated fractions (cause 6):** cannot be checked on 2.2 data, which has no answer boards.
- 117 of 248 staged explain boards are `compare@1` (a two-column text table). That is the most used template by a wide margin.

## Coverage

**Read fully**
- `server/content/*.js` (6 files).
- `scripts/kits/*` headers and entry points; each script dry-run where it has one.
- `data/curriculum`: every file through the graph checks (ids, chapter order, prerequisites, cycles, duplicate titles) and the validator.
- `data/placement`: all 456 items solved blind; every numeric key run through its own grader.
- `data/arena`: all 3,004 challenges checked against their kit item (key present once, no equal decoy, in step with the kit).
- `data/geo/india-places.json`: 61 places, all inside India's bounds, 13 spot-checked against known coordinates.
- `data/lesson-scripts-staged`: all 30 through the validator and the format comparison.

**Sampled**
- `data/kits`: every topic through `normalizeKit` and the structural checks; 1,010 of 12,597 items, 264 of 2,647 diagnostics and 72 worked examples solved blind.
- Hinglish: read by the solvers on the same sample, not on all 12,597 prompts.
- `data/arena`: about 60 of the 548 lifted-key challenges read by eye.

**Not read**
- `data/kits-relevel` item by item: it is already merged into the kits, and the kit sample includes re-levelled items.
- Whether the curriculum matches the printed NCERT books chapter by chapter: no web access in this audit. The class 9 books (Ganita Manjari, Kaveri, Exploration) are newer than anything I can check from memory.
- `evals/kit-runs`, which the kit scripts write to.

## Fixes applied on this branch

Each has a test in `tests/r7-audit-content-data.test.mjs` that fails on the tree as audited.

| Finding | Change |
|---|---|
| CD-01 | `server/content/next-topic.js`: `nextTopicFor` decides a topic on its askable skills only (`askableSkillIds`, `decidingStates`). Test: all 830 kit topics can reach "mastered"; class 5 Hindi moves from chapter 5 to chapter 6. |
| CD-05 | `c1-maths-ch03-t03-i11` Hindi now asks "Baad mein kaun aayega, 3 ya 7?". |
| CD-06 | `c6-english-ch01-t01-rl-h3` accepts the "an" forms. |
| CD-07 | `pl-c4-maths-m11` accepts "3:25 pm", "3:25", "3.25 pm", "3.25", "25 past 3" and three more; wrong times are still not credited. |
| CD-09 | `scripts/kits/friend-slot.py` re-run: 14 items and diagnostics now use `{friendF}`; 25 worked-example blocks use the fixed name the script gives them. Arena rebuilt (3 files changed; vakya, kaal and coverage banks checked, unchanged). |
| CD-10 | The three wrong accepted forms removed. |
| CD-11 | The nine lines corrected (the fence line now says "fence", the word a class 4 teacher uses). |
| CD-12 | `c7-sst-ch05-t01-m2` names both rulers and their dates in the question. |
| CD-21 | `data/kits/SCHEMA.md` lists the six subjects and the undocumented fields; stale comments corrected in `server/content/kits.js`, `scripts/kits/friend-slot.py`, `scripts/kits/lib/runner.mjs`. |
| CD-22 | The curriculum validator now runs in the test suite. |
