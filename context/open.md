## ledger-game-full-weight
`server/learner/kt/bktr.js temper()` has no source weight, so game and Forge-module commits move pL at full LR. The spec (§1.1) says ×0.5 game and ×0.75 module, and `facets.js` already applies that to U and T. In the 20-seed sim, not_yet accuracy was 0.62 with game evidence and 0.75 without, because lucky game predictions carry guessers over pL 0.6. The one-line diff is in INTEGRATION.md §5.1. The learner workstream owns the file.

- The CE-M1 bar fails under both families (0.627 / 0.475), and CE-M4 now fails at 14 pp after the truth-leak fix. Per SIM6, thresholds were NOT tuned to the simulator.
- Mutants VC2 and VC4 do not fail CE-M3 under bkt2, and VC4 does not fail under cfrag-lite either. By §8.3 the battery is therefore not yet valid for those mutants. The likely cause is too little game evidence: 2 C35 commits per fresh topic. A gamer or rank-exploit policy is needed.
- The oracle-prober control is not built, so 100% is undefined.
- cfrag-lite is not the evals/sim cfrag (no 4PL, no per-item γ).
