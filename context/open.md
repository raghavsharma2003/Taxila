## ledger-game-full-weight
`server/learner/kt/bktr.js temper()` has no source weight, so game and Forge-module commits move pL at full LR. The spec (§1.1) says ×0.5 game and ×0.75 module, and `facets.js` already applies that to U and T. In the 20-seed sim, not_yet accuracy was 0.62 with game evidence and 0.75 without, because lucky game predictions carry guessers over pL 0.6. The one-line diff is in INTEGRATION.md §5.1. The learner workstream owns the file.
